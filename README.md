<p>How to use?</p>

     <ol>First you need to install node.js on your PC✅</ol>
     <ol>Next download this repository and run the command npm i✅</ol>
     <ol>In the project directory, create a .env file✅</ol>
     <ol>Inside the .env file there should be 4 variables HOST, USER, PASS, PORT, <strong>the data below is for example (you need to replace them with your own, the mail can be anything that supports IMAP access, not just Gmail</strong>✅)
       <ul>
         <li>
           HOST=imap.gmail.com
         </li>
         <li>
           USER=username@gmail.com
         </li>
         <li>
           PASS=gmail password
         </li>
         <li>
           PORT=993
         </li>
       </ul>
   </ol>
   <ol>If you have completed the settings, you can open cmd and write the command <strong>node run start</strong> and the program will start collecting emails</ol>
   <ol>The result will be saved in the directory with the program in the folder /result/*.xlsx in an excel file</ol>
